# About Me 😊
I'm still learning every day, Alhamdulillah 📚. I love technology, entrepreneurship, and striving to hold onto the beautiful character of the Prophet ﷺ ✨.

Ever since I was little, I've been drawn to technology 💡. I actually started my tech journey around the COVID-19 days, when I began making fun little games using an app called Scratch 🎮.

My faith guides everything I do ❤️. I strive to follow the example of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) by staying humble, being kind, and remembering that all success comes from Allah ❤️. My goal isn't just to make money 💰; it is to achieve success that pleases Allah.

# Why This Website? 💭
I created this space to showcase my digital skills and share who I really am at heart ❤️. I wanted a platform where I could be transparent about what I'm learning, what I believe in, and the goals I am working toward 🎯.

I make mistakes sometimes 😅, but I am always trying to learn from them and improve. This website is a truthful log of that journey—showing up, remaining consistent, and staying connected to my values while building something meaningful ✨.

*May Allah bless this effort. 🤲*

# Goals & Values 🎯

## Entrepreneurship with Purpose 💼
I want to build businesses that create real value ❤️. I believe technology and ethics can work together beautifully. I am learning to innovate with AI automation while adhering to Islamic values and honest business practices, Inshallah 🤲.

## Faith-Driven Living 🕌
Islam is the foundation of my life. I strive to practice honesty, truthfulness, and kindness every single day 😊. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) taught that **"The best among you is the one who has the best character."** 🌟

## Helping Others 🤝
Whatever I earn is an Amanah (trust) from Allah 💰. My biggest dream is to use what I have to work toward Jannah. Success doesn't mean anything to me if it doesn't lead me closer to Jannah 🥺.

# Current Focus 🔍

## AI Automation 💡
I'm learning tools like **n8n** so I can build workflows that help businesses run more smoothly 🚀. Little by little, I'm getting more comfortable with automation.

## Computer Science & Tech 🚀
I'm building my technical foundation step by step, Alhamdulillah 📚. My focus is on understanding how technology can solve real-world problems in a way that's both ethical and genuinely impactful.

# Guiding Beliefs 🌟

> — Quran 40:40 ❤️

> "The best of people are those who are most beneficial to others." 🤝

These words keep me grounded, Alhamdulillah. Success without faith and service is empty 💭.
